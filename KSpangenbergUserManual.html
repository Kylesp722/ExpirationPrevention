	<h1> User Manual </h1>
	<hr>
	<h2> Technical Specifications</h2>
	<h3> Prototype</h3>
	<p>The prototype is compatible with the windows 10 operating system. The user’s computer will at least need a MB of ROM and 200 KB of RAM. The user’s computer will also need to be equipped with a network interface card (NIC) or a network adapter. The user will need a mouse and keyboard to interact with the application as touch screens will not be supported until the full release.</p>
	<h3> Full Release </h3>
	<p> For the full release the application will be compatible with both the windows operating system and the MAC OS. The user’s computer will need at least 260 MB of ROM and at least 200MB of RAM. The application will support touch screen if your device has this capability. The user also has the option of using either a handheld scanner or their phone camera to scan their food by scanning in the URL. In such an event as the user wanting to use a handheld wireless scanner the user’s computer will also need to be equipped with a Bluetooth adapter. The information put out by this manual going forward will be just for the prototype.</p>
	
	<h2> Directions on how to add food.</h2>
	<p> To use Expiration Prevention is very simple. All you must do is navigate to the food page. From this page go to button with the plus sign located in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. All you must do from here is fill out all the information and then click the Add button. You are also able to double click one of the listed food items and either remove the item or adjust the expiration date if the incorrect one was entered by mistake. Expiration prevention will also alert you to any food that is going to expire soon or has already expired. If the food is about to expire the food box will be highlighted yellow. If you see that a food box is highlighted red this means that the food has expired and from there you can either delete the food item or if the food still looks good, you can manually adjust the expiration date as previously mentioned.  If you see a food box that is highlighted green this means that the food does not have an expiration date and one will have to be entered.</p>
	
	<h2> Directions on how to use the meals page.</h2>
	<p> To generate a meal from Expiration Prevention all you must do is simply navigate to the Meals page. From this page it will display what meals you can make with the on-hand ingredients and will organize them in a descending order with the meal containing items that are expiring very soon at the top. You can then select whichever meal you are interested in cooking. Once the meal has been selected it will bring up that meals page. In the ingredients portion you will find the item that is expiring soon highlighted and all other ingredients you will need to cook the meal. In the directions portion of the page you will find the directions for you to follow in order to cook the meal. From this page you can either hit the cancel or the cook button. If you hit the cancel button you will be simply redirected back to the meals page but if you hit the cook button the ingredients listed in the ingredients portion of the page will be automatically removed from your foods page. </p>
	
	<h2> General Safety Precautions </h2>
	<p>The following is the general safety precautions you should take while using this application. As you will be the one that is entering in the expiration date you should be very careful that the date that is entered matches what is printed on the label. So if you incorrectly enter a date, Expiration Prevention will build its meal recommendations around incorrect data. Expiration dates are also just an estimate, so if the food looks to be spoiled do not use it. Another thing to keep in mind is that Expiration Prevention will not recommend a certain meal if one of the listed ingredients is already expired. This is done with the users health and safety in mind. If you inspect the ingredient and find that it is still good you are able to adjust the expiration date. This will put that food back into the rotation and Expiration Prevention will once again build meals using that item. It is strongly recommended that great care is taken to inspect any food for any signs of spoilage once the food has exceeded its posted expiration date as this can lead to food poisoning. </p>
