		<p> With Expiration Prevention all you must do is enter in what ingredients you have and when they expire. Once you do Expiration prevention will generate meals that you are able to cook with the ingredients you have on hand. The best part is Expiration Prevention will organize those generated meals based on when the ingredients expire. When using Expiration Prevention, you will on occasion see the meal text as four different colors. The color that you will see most often is white as this color is used to as the normal text color and none of the following conditions apply. If the text color is red this means that this meal contains an ingredient that has expired. You will have to inspect that ingredient for yourself to determine if that ingredient is still good. If the ingredients are still good, you will need to cook that meal as soon as possible. If the text color is yellow this means that the meal contains an ingredient that will expire in the next 48 hours. If the text color is green this means that when you were entering in the ingredients, you didnâ€™t enter an expiration date for that ingredient. If the meal is red or green you will be unable view the directions for how to cook the meal until the expiration date is adjusted or entered. </p>
