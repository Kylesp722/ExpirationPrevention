	<p> In 2010 the FDA found that between 30-40% of all food used in the private and industrial sectors of the United States was wasted. A large portion of this waste is from food expiring before it can be consumed. As children transition to adulthood, they will be faced with a new challenge. This challenge is cooking for themselves or eating out. Many of these new adults will try cooking as it is the cheaper option, but they will be very inefficient in using the food that they purchase and will end up wasting a large portion of it. This will in turn cause them to waste additional money and therefore defeat their original purpose of cooking to save money. If this sounds like a problem that you are having check out Expiration Prevention. At just $1 a month this simple application will make this a problem of the past.</p>
