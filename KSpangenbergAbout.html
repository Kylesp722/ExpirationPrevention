	<h1>About Expiration Prevention </h1>
	<p> My name is Kyle Spangenberg. I started this project when I first started ITCC298. The reason why I chose Expiration Prevention as my project was becuase I believe that it is something that could help alleviate a problem that myself and others face. This problem is food waste. People are always wanting to save money by cooking their own meals but frequently they will not think about when stuff expires and therefore, they will end up wasting food and therefore wasting money. Which defeates their original reason on why they started cooking. With Expiration Prevention this will be a problem of the past. </p>
